PacMacieson is small console game written in C++.
It's written rather poorly by enthusiast teenager.

Enemies will approach you when you're within 3 tiles
Contact with an enemy is deadly
You'll get to the next level after collecting 10 points
Enemies can collect points and buffs too!
Have a nice game!
